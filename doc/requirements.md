# Requirements

The system should meet two basic requirement:

* Run Linux or OS X on the local workstation
* Install the [nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix/)
* (Recommended) Install `git` for command-line usage

Additionally, you should have some basic understanding of the tools/systems involved:

* Git
* PHP/JS development (e.g. `composer`, `npm`)
* Unix CLI (e.g. `bash`)
* Process management (e.g. `ps`, `kill`), esp for `httpd` and `mysqld`
* Filesystem management (e.g. "Disk Utility" on OSX; `umount` on Linux)

## TIP: Installing the nix package manager

The `nix` package manager is used for downloading binaries.  It stores the
binaries in the folder `/nix`.  This design provides isolation/independence
from your host operating system (Ubuntu, RedHat, OSX, etc).

To install it, run one of these commands as your regular (sudo-capable) user:

```
sh <(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon

sh <(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install) --no-daemon
```

The two commands differ by one option:

* __Multi-user mode (`--daemon`)__: The `/nix` folder will be managed as a system service.
  It's (slightly) more robust and (slightly) more secure, but it has (slightly) higher system requirements.
  (Ex: *For Linux, the host OS must have `systemd`.*)
  The manual has more complete [install and uninstall instructions](https//nixos.org/nix/manual/#sect-multi-user-installation).

* __Single-user mode (`--no-daemon`)__: The `/nix` folder will be managed exclusively for your regular console user.
  It has (slightly) broader compatibility, and it's (slightly) easier to uninstall, but it's (slightly) less secure.
  The manual has more complete [install and uninstall instructions](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#sect-single-user-installation).

> NOTE: The "daemon" in "multi-user" mode is an internal service that manages download/installation (akin to
> `dockerd`).  For our purposes, `nix` does not start, stop, or register any network services.
